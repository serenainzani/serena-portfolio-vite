# Portfolio with Vite

# Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

# Why Vite?
Previously, I have created my portfolio with Next.js. This was overkill for the needs of the web app, so when I wanted to redesign my portofolio I went with Vite. This has helped improve my development speed and app size, so I am happy with the decision.

# Design
I wanted a more unique and retro design compared to my first portfolio, so I used 1990s and 2000s retail catalogues as the inspiration.
